# Sign-Language-Detection
This model presents a method designed to aid communication for individuals who are deaf or mute by translating hand gestures into corresponding text. The proposed approach aims to enable people with disabilities to express their thoughts and interact more easily with others. Using a neural network model, the method seeks to bridge communication barriers and enhance their quality of life. Specifically, the model focuses on sign language recognition, utilizing a dataset of hand gestures split into training, validation, and testing sets. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then applied to identify different sign characters accurately. It is tested on random data to further validate the model’s reliability. What sets this model apart is the integration of mixed pooling operations and the Mish activation function, which allow for smoother and more robust training, ultimately improving the model’s precision and accuracy in recognizing sign characters. The techniques employed include CNN, Mish activation, and mixed pooling for optimal sign character detection.
